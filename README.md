# AREP_Taller6

## Secure Application Design
In this workshop, we will design and deploy a secure, scalable application using AWS infrastructure with a focus on best practices for security. Our architecture will feature two primary components:

### Server 1: Apache Server
The Apache server will be responsible for serving an asynchronous HTML+JavaScript client over a secure connection using TLS. Client-side code will be delivered through encrypted channels, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality during download.
### Server 2: Spring Framework
The Spring server will handle backend services, offering RESTful API endpoints. These services will also be protected using TLS, ensuring secure communication between the client and the backend.
